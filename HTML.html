                <div class="p1">Hi! My name is Tia Pickens and I am a Graphic and UX/UI Designer. I specialize in creating user-centered experiences that are intuitive, visually appealing and functional, while also solving user problems and translating them into design solutions that enhance usability and satisfaction. </div>
                <div class="p2">When it comes to my design thinking and thought process, I start my foundation from using the Double Diamond method, an iterative process in which I often revisit phases of my design journey as I gather more insight and then continuously refine my understanding of the problem until I can deliver a solid final product.</div>
                <div class="p3">I love seeing the excitement and gratification from users that interact with my craft; "Do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life" truly does apply to me. I’m a  master of many hats, and work best in any kind of environment that will allow me to use all of my skills to the fullest!</div>

                <div id="study1" class="heroGridArea"></div>
                <p>The website "Resources for Exceptional Children and Youth" is an indispensable reserve of knowledge for Parents and Education Professionals alike, who need a place to access key information and programs for special needs children/youth. Users felt a sense of overwhelm and a general lack of guidance on finding those resources, which my team and I felt we could fix with a redesign of their UI.
